## About Repo
In this repo, all the exercises of the Machine Learning lesson are placed. Each exercise is placed in a separate notebook. It should be noted that we have done all the exercises together with my sister, so the similarity in the codes is to be expected. For this reason, we are ready for any additional explanations about doing homework.
